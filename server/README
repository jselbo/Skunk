I've created a rackup file that lets you simply run

  rackup -p <some_port_between_3000_and_4000>

instead of

  ruby server.rb -p <some_port_between_3000_and_4000>

Such savings, I know...but it means we'll be able to make complex changes more
easily later on. So, just use something like

  rackup -p 3010

to run the server for testing.
